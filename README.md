The files in this repository belong to the paper 'Convex Clustering of Mixed Numerical and Categorical Data'. This paper extends the technique of convex clustering, a clustering technique that does not suffer from instabilities, to data sets where both numerical and categorical features are present. Explain a bit more what's in the paper.

To implement MIDACC in practice, we apply the R software. In running the code belonging to our implementation, users should follow the following steps. First, we load in some R packages. More specifically, we advise users to load in the following packages:
- cluster
- clusterpath
- clustMD
- clusterMixType
- data.table
- DisimForMixed
- dplyr
- e1071
- fossil
- hesim
- installr
- kamila
- LaplacesDemon
- MASS
- matrixStats
- mclust
- mltools
- ModelMetrics
- pracma
- readr

After having loaded in the packages, users should import the following code files contained in the current repository.
